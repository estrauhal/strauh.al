      <p>

        today i have become so bored that i have decided to start a diary..;  currently stuck in some random suburb of illinois in my aunt and uncles basement and playing with this new drug my psychiatrist gave me called wellbutrin.  <br><br>

        i called walgreens today about my prescription and i could tell the person on the other end was getting fed up with how slow my brain was moving because of the drug.  <br><br>

        anyway, the reason i'm messing around with wellbutrin is because my psychiatrist diagnosed me with a whole grab bag of mental disorders.  <a href="diary/pp,504x498-pad,600x600,f8f8f8.u1.jpg">lol.</a>  in all honesty, i should have asked for something more fun like <a href="diary/ritalin.jpg">ritalin or adderall</a><br><br>

        i'm sure i'll probably forget about this journal in a week when i inevitably find something new to hyperfixate on <br><br>

        <p>

        it's 1:58 am so i guess i was eager to get this entry in.  just finished up a 2 hour vr session; i feel better now.  <br><br><a href="culture_society/247424134_4622366904474315_1086021457600591051_n.jpg">is it sad that i prefer virtual reality over actual reality?  i can't explain the feeling, but when i'm in the web browser on the headset, i feel disappointed that i am unable to be sucked entirely into the website.</a>  i guess this makes me cringe and bluepilled, but that's just how i feel.  <br><br>

        <a href="diary/3995203629_26fb31e2e2_z.jpg">my dream one of these days is that they'll figure out how to get rid of my body and just keep my brain hooked up to a computer.</a>  now, i sort of understand millennials when they complain about being "bags of meat on a hecking ball of dirt speeding through spacerino"

        had a panic attack inside of my dream last night.  pretty sure it's related to the wellbutrin.<br><br>

      <p>

        at this point i’ve gotten accustomed to wellbutrin so i am now able to pull off a pretty convincing fluoride stare <br><br>

        <a href="diary/54dfc0cbd9b761fb276b428b99dc9589.jpg">how do i feel when i’m on this drug? well, i no longer want to make art anymore. any creative impulses that were lingering in my brain have now been beaten out. i just stare at my fucking computer all day and do nothing. i wish i were dead </a><br><br>

        for the past 23 years, i have been a very reactive person. i would intake stimuli, and just react without being fully present in the moment. <a href="old_photos/oldphotos 50.png">i was like a raw nerve for two decades, and i was unknowingly taken advantage of by people for this reason.</a> <br><br>

        i feel like if i talk to other people about this they’ll say something like the only person you can blame is yourself. And they're right. it just feels so good to have someone or some thing to blame though. i have largely forgotten what has happened in those years .  <a href="https://strauh.al/more_fine_art/FzBluNCWYAE5dtT.jpeg">The main emotions i feel now are a mixture of shame and regret knowing that i have probably been a burden to everyone i’ve met in my life.</a><br><br>

        i’ve been taking the metra a lot recently. <a href="diary/hf_1_2021_06_16.jpg">there tends to be a large number of amish people that travel through the station. they look so quaint.</a> right now i’m looking at an amish family and the husband and wife are wearing these strange hats and the son is dressed up in a pair of adorable overalls. <br><br>

        i’m thinking that they probably have better mental health than most terminally online American people do. Maybe we should all be amish.

        <a href="diary/90.jpeg">thinking about this quote today:</a><br><br>

        “For the new year. – i’m still alive; i still think: i must still be alive because i still have to think. Sum, ergo cogito: cogito, ergo sum.1 Today everyone allows himself to express his dearest wish and thoughts: so i, too, want to say what i wish from myself today and what thought first crossed my heart – what thought shall be the reason, warrant, and sweetness of the rest of my life! i want to learn more and more how to see what is necessary in things as what is beautiful in them – thus i will be one of those who make things beautiful. Amor fati:2 let that be my love from now on! i do not want to wage war against ugliness. i do not want to accuse; i do not even want to accuse the accusers. Let looking away be my only negation! And, all in all and on the whole: some day i want only to be a Yes-sayer!”

        i was puzzled by this as our project didn't remotely have anything to do with "diversity and inclusion" ...;  apparently (according to their logic) americans will automatically favor projects that have those words;  hmmmmm... okay lol

        when i look back at all the music i made the past couple of years, i think 2022-early2023 was my slop era.  i would just take 15 second snippets of obscure songs and stretch them out to 6 minutes.  truly artistically bankrupt.  <a href="album_covers/thousand_knives.jpg">it wasn't until ryuichi sakamoto died that i realized i needed to put more effort into my music.</a>  <br><br>

        also i guess i should be more transparent to myself about the nature of this diary.  this is probably the first time in my life i've been able to keep up a journal for over a few weeks.  also, it's not like i'm writing this in a cute little moleskine book or anything, i'm writing this in html that will be hosted on a url for others to read if they have the link.  haven't really publicly or privately shared this with any people yet.  right now, it just feels like me and the internet.  <br><br>

        <a href="photography/couple.jpg">by that, i don't mean other people on the internet, i mean if the infrastructure powering the internet developed a consciousness, this diary would be a nice little secret that me and the internet would share.</a>

        <a href="culture_society/iMG_4371.JPG">good ;  they should also ban instagram reels and youtube shorts as well.  it might suck for everyone in the short term but millions (perhaps billions) of man-hours will be taken back.  think of all the things we could accomplish [collectively]</a><br><br>

        also now that i think about it, that's probably the reason i gave up on starting a record label haha.  how can artists/musicians compete with an endless stream of entertainment that is tailored to the user?  i should have realized this well before i even started working on the webpage/bandcamp page for the label considering that tiktok was already around for a few years

        in the future, everyone will either be an uber driver, a doordasher or an onlyfans model.  perhaps a combination of those things all at once.  everyone will also be genderfluid / nonbinary as well.  this fluidity will extend to politics, sports, language, employment, art, music, sexuality, religion, nationality, and race too lol.  <br><br>

        i think that would be so based.  <a href="diary/laion-clusters.jpeg">each of these characteristics will be labeled as vector coordinates in some sort of latent space.  people will be able to see the distances they've covered in each dimension of the latent space and they'll be able to see their own trajectories (along with everyone elses) through the space based on their current and past movement.</a>  <br><br>

      	anyway, someone said that the best answer to that question in any situation is "a tribe called quest"<br><br>

      	apparently, if you say that, 100% of the time, people will nod their heads inquisitively and go "ah yes, a tribe called quest...."<br><br>

        <a href="old_photos/oldphotos 16.png">i guess i should explain this picture before i suddenly develop dementia or something.</a><br><br>

        this picture was taken of me on the first day of kindergarten and this might also be the first drawing i’ve ever made.  the teacher had provided a bunch of coloring sheets for all the students and everyone was doing a great job of coloring inside the lines…   …except for me.  this isn’t a metaphor for anything by the way, my parents saw the wall of coloring sheets that were stapled to the wall and my drawing stood out from the rest, and not in a good way.<br><br>  

        apparently, i had wrapped all 5 of my pudgy fingers around a green crayon and took the coloring sheet to task.  whether the sheet of paper had any outlines on it didn't matter at all because i covered the entire thing with scribbles.  now that i think about it, that might be why my kindergarten teacher told my parents that i might have been autistic (or maybe because i was nonverbal for the first 5 years of my life hahah).<br><br>

        also this first art memory reminds me of my first memory of pain.  a year after kindergarten when i was in the first grade, my mother told me to doodle something on a piece of paper for a city wide drawing competition.  anyway, i probably made something in less than 30 minutes and went back to doing whatever it is that five year olds do.  <a href="old_photos/oldphotos 117.png">what i had not expected was that my drawing was chosen over every other first grader’s drawing in the school district.  i mean really, this was not a technically skilled drawing for a five year old, especially compared to my classmates who had probably spent more time doing better drawings.</a><br><br>  

        annyyyyywayyyyyy, i had received a ribbon as an award for this drawing which hung on the top shelf in my bedroom.  one night, i climbed up the shelf to grab the ribbon and was swishing the ribbon through the air by its string.  however, the string that was attached to the ribbon snagged on the doorknob and tore all of the skin off of my ring finger.  not fun<br><br>

        hopefully this entry sheds some light on an early moment that might have led me to become the self indulgent, egomaniac piece of shit "artist" i am today.  <br><br>

        <a href="diary/jacfast3.png">also, to create art requires love.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and pain.</a><br><br>  

        something that these dork ass losers making ai art have probably never felt lol.

        went out to michigan for a friend’s birthday this weekend (and also sort of my birthday but not as much since it was 3 days away).  <a href="culture_society/316039365_179339704757870_2199304955362900529_n.jpg">did whatever it is that older people do.  wine tasting.  $200 on 10 bites of food.  i felt a strange sense of dread in the air.</a>  they asked me if i wanted anything for my birthday and i said i wanted to get hit by a truck.  i thought it was slightly funny but they didn’t laugh.  <br><br>

        i don’t even want to do anything for my birthday.  i just want to be alone.  later that night, i was asked again what i wanted for my birthday,;  i laughed and flatly told them i wish i were dead.  they jumped back and asked me to repeat myself to which i said “i wish i had a pet.”  then they started talking about hermit crabs as pets or something like that.  <br><br>

        i don’t even want a pet.  that was a lie.  i only chose that word because it sounded similar to dead.  i can’t even take care of myself properly, let alone a pet.  <a href="culture_society/332700874_590062542966362_7927382051136827917_n.jpg">my life isn’t even terrible;  i’m not living under a bridge or having my house carpet-bombed, but everything is just so tiring</a>

        **update (october 16th): i think i made this entry with my cousin stanley in mind.  i saw him when he was still in good health although his wife told me that he was going to be in a wheelchair in a few months because of ALS.  eventually he'll need to have a feeding tube.  <br><br>

        anyway, when i visited him and his family with my mother in new york last year, i thought it was gonna be pretty chill until my mom took a bible out of her purse and tried to christpill him.  to which he told my mother that a bunch of other aunts had tried to do the same.  his wife told me in another room that most people with ALS have 3 to 5 years to live after the diagnosis.

        this weekend was nice?..?  i guess.  it’s the first weekend in a while that didn't have too many emotions spilling over.  not that i’m doing or saying anything in particular, i just sit there, watching everything unfold.  <br><br>

        randomly remembered something i saw a few miles away from my parent's home when i was back there in september.  i was wandering around in a large field and saw a shopping cart in the distance.  it felt very strange..;  it had a monumental quality about it., just sitting there by itself in the middle of this field.  and rightfully so.  the shopping cart is a uniquely american invention, for a uniquely american activity.  <br><br>

        also, perceptions of shopping carts can be very subjective.  what may be a negligible mode of transporting products or groceries for one person may be a vehicle filled with personal objects for another.<br><br>

        here's an excerpt from a wikipedia article about the early days of the shopping cart: <br><br>

        <i>The invention did not catch on immediately. Men found them effeminate; women found them suggestive of a baby carriage. "i've pushed my last baby buggy," offended women informed him. After hiring several male and female models to push his new invention around his store and demonstrate their utility, as well as greeters to explain their use, his folding-style shopping carts became extremely popular and Goldman became a multimillionaire by collecting a royalty on every folding design shopping cart in the United States.</i><br><br>

        <a href="computers/god.png">actually, now that i think about it maybe i shouldn’t get the battery replaced. i kind of like the urgency i feel when i’m working when my battery is at 1%  it feels like i have a human skull on my desk.</a><br><br>

        <a href="more_fine_art/St-peters-basilica-interior-pannini-1735.jpg">i remember in third grade,  my teacher would place me in in the special education room? This was very strange to me, because i was just sitting around and we weren’t really doing anything:;,</a> there was basically no instruction going on. <br><br>

        anyway, perhaps she did that because she was upset that she couldn’t put me on ritalin after telling my mother that i might have ADHD. <a href="more_fine_art/tumblr_989687c381cdd655b835f3ab471c8494_33cf1a38_1280.jpg">i remember when i was placed in this particular teacher’s classroom, my mother was excited because this teacher had received the “teacher of the year award.”</a><br><br>

        i think i realized that most social media “activism” (or student activism) was bogus after that <a href="diary/rafah.jpg">“all eyes on rafah” post .  a few months ago, someone had used an AI GENERATED image of a bunch of refugee encampments that spelled out “all eyes on rafah" since israel was bombing the shit out of it.</a> <br><br>

        this image blew up in popularity (47 million reposts) and soon these ai sloppers were arguing over who created this image first.  <a href="diary/noshitsherlock.jpg">social media activism was always a race to the bottom</a> but at least people were pretending to keep up the facade of actual effort by creating art or slides specifically for these issues.  <br><br>

        i still keep myself up to date on this stuff, but after 1 or 2 performative gestures on my end, i realized that i was being a bit cringe.  everyone already has come to a general consensus that "war bad.  genocide bad."  like everything else after that point is just for optics lol<br><br>

        now people are just arguing over ai generated activism slop.  we’re at the bottom.  we’ve finally arrived<br><br>

        reminds me of this quote:<br><br>

        I will finish, however, with a word about my own preferences. I get the keenest pleasure from drawings which are essentially spontaneous, in which there is the smallest time lag between the feeling-the desire-the ache to draw, and its expression. Drawings in which there has been no time for emotion to evaporate or run to seed in the sludge of some labourious technical style. Even in the brash bravura of Epstein or John there is much pleasure to be derived from the sheer immediacy and impact of spontaneity. But there are drawings in which only the merest tremble of line separates the emotion from its expression, and this is the drawing of the great masters. Into this category come the line drawings of Rodin, and those inexpressibly delicate and beautiful early studies of Picasso, such as the Deux Nus (41). There is here a distillation of emotion, so rare, so refined, a communication of spirit so bathed in poetry and compassion, so tender and moving, that the heart melts. There is no problem of communication here, nor the need of any further words from me.<br><br>

        thought about my friend quinn from preschool.  they were the one that really got me into legos.  the set they gave me couldn’t have contained more than 30 pieces but that basically ignited my obsession for legos for the first 12 years of my life.  <br><br>

        <a href="2023_downloadsfolder/IMG_2471.JPG">i keep on referring to quinn as “they” because i had no idea if they were a boy or a girl.  to be honest, i never cared to ask.</a>  i think one time, my parents asked me if i knew whether quinn was a boy or girl to which i happily said “i don’t know!”  sadly, identity politics on both the right and left has perverted my innocent view of gender

VIVA LA VIDA  is written in graffiti marker over it.  a violin overlaid on a kick drum plays on loop.   vague gestures towards religious and historical figures.  the aspirations of revolution, transcendence, and meaning sold as a commercial product.  i think i have developed a perverse appreciation for coldplay because of this.  a paradoxical loop of revulsion and attraction <br><br>

        i am tired of this blatant disregard for the image by other artists .  when i see an installation that has a bunch of shit piled on top of itself, i don’t think the artist is a very smart person.  <a href="diary/justhiking.jpg">on the contrary, i think that artist is kind of a dolt for not contributing something compact and transmissible to the history of art.  making something “site specific” or “time based” isn’t any better than a painting, drawing, or even a photograph.  in fact, it just makes the artist look like a talentless diva (often with bad taste, yes i used to do this in undergrad).</a>   art historians in the future (especially future art historians born after 2020) will not have the patience to sift  through thousands of “time based interactive installations”.  <br><br>

        one of the few times i have been truly impressed by an “installation” was when i saw an artist create a spatial audio installation in which a digitally projected butterfly hovers around a wall, occasionally landing on the speaker wires strung across the wall.  <br><br>

        that was a very *very* nice moment

        prefer dreams to reality now.  <a href="diary/byeshinzo.jpg">the only version of reality i can actually stand is virtual reality.</a>  need a heroic dose of any hallucinogen to either wake me up or scare me straight

        why am i so drawn towards the vr headset?  could it be that i'm trying to grasp towards the source of power in the oedipal love triangle?  <a href="diary/hellyeah.jpg">normally, the child sees the father as the source of power blocking the child from the mother, but now both the father and the mother have succumbed to a greater power: the screen</a> (memeanalysis).  <br><br>

        <a href="diary/tip.JPG">i’ll never forget the first time i saw the blue glow of the computer screen against my father’s face.</a>  it had an otherworldly draw to it ; as a 5 year old, i intuitively knew there was a kind of sacred energy about the computer .  <a href="old_photos/oldphotos 116.png">after what felt like an hour of begging and crying to use the computer, my father finally put me on his lap and let me experience the internet for the first time.</a>  <br><br>

        to me, a vr headset feels like the most visceral, uncompromising exposure to that oedipal power.  like riding a missile through cyberspace.<br><br>

        but why vellum?  i love asking myself this question.  when i dropped out of design school at the request of my professors, i still had all of my design tools with me . ..my vellum pads and technical pens..  <a href="diary/palak5.png">i needed a tool and a substrate that would punish me and teach me true intention *get it right on the first stroke!*   you can’t erase a penstroke.  and you can see right through vellum.  no undos or redos.</a> <br><br>

        ..why can’t i use these tools to make art?<br><br>

        <a href="diary/warhol.png">there is something quite spiritual about using the internet, especially if you’re a creative person that shares their work.</a>  bits of your mind, pieces of art, created both physically and digitally are leaving through your fingers traveling at near light speed around the globe to thousands of other people.

        had another strange VR dream last night. i was casually talking to people in the headset, and i noticed someone sitting next to me in the room. i just figured they were another digital avatar in the world and i glanced away. however, something felt different about their avatar  and I looked back in their direction and took the headset off;  <a href="diary/systems.jpg">they were an actual real person in the dream instead of in VR.  somehow, i could see their form in the dream and inside of a vr headset in the dream</a><br><br> 

        the combination of Wellbutrin and virtual reality has really made my dreams quite interesting.

        there are few things that make me really upset.  but man, when i find ai slop in the image search results for a real human artist, that really does send me into a rage

        this diary began as an earnest (heh) attempt at recording daily events, but has morphed into autofiction. i am actively narrativizing in my life.  don’t believe half the things you’re reading in this diary.  i mean obviously, pretty much everyone on social media is spoonfeeding you a narrativized version of their life, but when you have to type it out and read it back in your head, it's a bit more mental, isn't it?  taking pictures of yourself and sharing them is much easier than actively verbalizing what's going on.

        i don't really care about money.  chinese people have this thing where they tell you to hold your hand up to the light, and the more light that shines through the cracks between your fingers, the more easily money will fall through your fingers.  true lol.  it feels like every time i breathe, money leaves my bank account.  <br><br>

        that being said, i don't really care for designer clothes or fancy sneakers.  if money were no object, i would like to live in a tadao ando house.  and then i'd fill that house with paintings, probably a mix between clyfford still, richard mayhew, and cy twombly.  maybe i'd throw a couple of rembrandts in there to mess with people.<br><br>

        i'm thinking live recordings of autechre's shows would be the soundtrack for this house.

        I love authenticity in art. I also love inauthenticity in art. The problem for me is when an artist sets out to be authentic, but due to the process or circumstances in their lives, the piece fails to live up to their authenticity.  However, what really gets my mind spinning (in a nice way) is when an artist authentically strives to be inauthentic. Or even when they are inauthentic in trying to render inauthenticity.  <br><br>

        like, it becomes a skill at a certain point to not care about not caring.  the lack of deliberation becomes an act of deliberation in itself.
