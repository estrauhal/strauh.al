What comes to mind when you hear the word “sculpture”? Perhaps a stone bust of a Greek God. A statue dedicated to a historical figure. Maybe an abstract shape with complex meaning. 

You certainly don’t think of mobiles, although that’s exactly what you find at the SFMOMA’s Elemental Calder exhibit. Located in a gallery on the third floor, you find yourself surrounded by a vast collection of Alexander Calder’s sculptural work. Enormous mobiles and stabiles that depict the four elements – earth, fire, water and air.    

Alexander Calder was fascinated by astronomical realities and collected astronomy machines depicting the solar system. So it was natural that one of his major art forms would be the mobile, a series of objects suspended in space. Such a creation can be seen in “Double Gong” “1953,” in the show.

“23 Spreading Leaves” (1945) is a large metal sculpture comprised of many mobiles. The triangular parts move slowly, independently, some in opposing directions. The piece is painted black, so it surprises you how intensely you can see leaves blowing in the wind. It’s a vibrant scene that reminds you of autumn and jumping into a pile of freshly raked leaves. 

“Aquarium (1929) is a small and stagnant sculpture, just a thin wire twisted into loose shapes, yet you detect motion. You visualize a goldfish swimming in bowl of clear blue water. The fish’s movement causes the sea grass to undulate along the bottom of the bowl, rolling with the soft ripples.  


“Always beginning over again, always new.”

“It’s not a mobile, but a sculptural work of art in its own right with movement and color and unseen forces. A living, breathing masterpiece.”
