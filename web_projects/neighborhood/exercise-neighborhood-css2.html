        <p>The Sunset District holds a very special place in my heart, as not only is it one of the few places in San Francisco that's not filled to the brim with tech workers,
          but it still has a sense of identity and quirkiness that has not been able to be replicated by other suburbs in California.  <br><br>My family lived in the Sunset District
        for quite some time before I started attending public school in Sacramento.  Despite not having lived here for over a decade, this place still feels like home to me.</p>

      <h2>The Sunset Branch</h2>
        <p>The Sunset Branch of the San Francisco Public Library is an excellent place to sit down, relax, and enjoy some books and magazines.<br>They also have a healthy selection of Chinese magazines, books, and films, for the large Chinese population in the Sunset.

      <h2>Cafe La Flore</h2>
        <p>La Flore is one of my favorite cafes to study at, and their vanilla mochas are absolutely exemplary.  <br>I wasn't exactly expecting their sandwiches to be so artfully presented, but that's just another plus.

      <h2>Ocean Beach</h2>
        <p>Ocean Beach may be incredibly cold, but it's always nice to take off your shoes and feel the sand between your toes.<br>As a toddler, my parents would always take me to Ocean Beach since it was just a short walk from our house.

      <h2>Grand View Park</h2>
        <p>Grand View Park, also known as "Turtle Hill" has an amazing view of the Sunset District as well as Golden Gate Park and downtown SF.  <br>Other than Twin Peaks, Turtle Hill packs an amazing 360 degree view of the city, and is a great place for getting exercise, as this place sits at 666 feet above sea level.
