        <p id="intro">The Sunset District holds a very special place in my heart, as not only is it one of the few places in San Francisco that's not filled to the brim with tech workers,
          but it still has a sense of identity and quirkiness that has not been able to be replicated by other suburbs in California.  <br>My family lived in the Sunset District
        for quite some time before I started attending public school in Sacramento.  Despite not having lived here for over a decade, this place still feels like home to me.</p><br><br>

      <h2>The Sunset Branch</h2>
        <p>The Sunset Branch of the San Francisco Public Library is an excellent place to sit down, relax, and enjoy some books and magazines.<br>They also have a healthy selection of Chinese magazines, books, and films, for the large Chinese population in the Sunset.

      <h2>Cafe La Flore</h2>
        <p>La Flore is one of my favorite cafes to study at, and their vanilla mochas are absolutely exemplary.  <br>I wasn't exactly expecting their sandwiches to be so artfully presented, but that's just another plus.

        <p>Located in Golden Gate Park alongside the Sunset and Richmond neighborhoods, the De Young is a wonderful place to learn about contemporary art, along with installations from renowned artists.

      <h2>The Academy of Sciences</h2>
        <p>Also located in Golden Gate Park is the Academy of Sciences, a place where you can learn about aquatic life, prehistoric life, and much more in just one place.  <br>Although tickets may be expensive, there are actually free days for Bay Area residents.

      <h2>The Mosaic Stairway</h2>
        <p>The tiles of the Mosaic Stairway was made by over 300 neighbors along with donations from 220 other neighbors.  <br>When you finally reach the top of the stairs, you're greeted with breathtaking view of the Golden Gate Bridge, Pacific Ocean, and the Financial District.

      <h2>Grand View Park</h2>
        <p>Grand View Park, also known as "Turtle Hill" has an amazing view of the Sunset District as well as Golden Gate Park and Downtown San Francisco.  <br>Other than Twin Peaks, Turtle Hill packs an amazing 360 degree view of the city, and is a great place for getting exercise, as this place sits at 666 feet above sea level.
