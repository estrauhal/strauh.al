<p>The Ainu tribes, located in Northern Japan, is known for their throat singing technique called Rekuhkara. Rekuhkara, also performed by two women, is done by two women forming a tube with their hands and then chanting into each others mouths and throats. This cavity acts as a way of the performers using each others mouths and throats as a resonator to give the technique a unique sound. In addition, this technique also utilizes the inhale as a sound, although less so than Inuit throat singing.

	<br><br>

Because throat singing as a practice is generally thought to have originated in the Mongolian/Tibetan/Siberian region, it is reasonable to believe that the Ainu could possibly have been influenced by these groups who are close in geographic proximity.Because of the unusual nature of the singing, efforts to revive the practice have emerged in recent years, using old recordings as reference. Similar techniques also exist amongst Inuit cultures, Katajiaq, with the two cultures sharing Siberian heritage, possibly also linking them to Tuvan throat singing.
