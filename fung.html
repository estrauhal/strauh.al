    <h3>About Gordon</h3>

    <img src="gordon.jpeg">

      <p>
        Gordon Fung (b. 1988, San Francisco) is a transdisciplinary artist who works across various fields, including: installation, sound art, video art, multi-/ new media, digital art, assemblage, experimental and conceptual arts, etc. As a believer of interconnectivity in all matters, he sees no boundaries between disciplines and school of thoughts. His polymathic and syncretic approach dissolves imposed boundaries and fuses them into a reinvented artistic discourse. As a formally trained composer, he has established himself in the international scene and has received numerous recognitions. Yet the homogeneity in music composition inspires him to amalgamate all the skills and techniques acquired to withstand the imposed limitation in any media.

    <h3>About Ernest</h3>

    <img src="ernest.jpg">

      <p>
        Ernest Strauhal (b. 2000, San Francisco) works in sound, printmedia, and sculpture.  He has used the sounds of birds chirping, ambulance sirens, wind patterns across the Bay Area, and samples downloaded from random places on the internet to sculpt ambient and abrasive soundscapes.  <br><br>

        For the past two years, he has not owned or used a single instrument on his sound works.  Instead, he uses filters and external effects to add texture to completely change the identity of samples altogether (i.e. turning the sound of running water into an electric guitar).  His aim is to use the tools afforded by Mechanical Reproduction to usher in a new Age of Art.
