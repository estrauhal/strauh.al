    <img src="ernest.png">

      <p>
        Ernest Strauhal (b. 2000, San Francisco) works in sound, printmedia, and sculpture. Drawing references from the environment, he incorporates sounds such as birds chirping, ambulance sirens, wind sounds, and samples downloaded from random places in his works. He sculpts ambient and abrasive soundscapes to open up new ways of listening.<br><br>

        <!-- His polymathic and syncretic approach dissolves imposed boundaries and fuses them into a reinvented artistic discourse. As a formally trained composer, he has established himself in the international scene and has received numerous recognitions. Yet the homogeneity in music composition inspires him to amalgamate all the skills and techniques acquired to withstand the imposed limitation in any media.  -->
