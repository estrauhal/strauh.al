      <p>

        today i have become so bored that i have decided to start a diary..;  currently stuck in some random suburb of illinois in my aunt and uncles basement and playing with this new drug my psychiatrist gave me called wellbutrin.  <br><br>

        i called walgreens today about my prescription and i could tell the person on the other end was getting fed up with how slow my brain was moving because of the drug.  <br><br>

        anyway, the reason i'm messing around with wellbutrin is because my psychiatrist diagnosed me with a whole grab bag of mental disorders.  <a href="diary/pp,504x498-pad,600x600,f8f8f8.u1.jpg">lol.</a>  in all honesty, i should have asked for something more fun like <a href="diary/artworks-GJKOxCkv18iZNWZt-QBaiiQ-t500x500.jpg">ritalin or adderall</a><br><br>

        i'm sure i'll probably forget about this journal in a week when i inevitably find something new to hyperfixate on <br><br>

        <a href="https://strauh.al/more_fine_art/Harmony1956_Armonia_-RemediosVaro_6543542b-437e-46e1-b2db-e1e4d9b5bd13.jpg">here's a painting</a>

      <h2>august 28th, 2024</h2>

        <p>

        it's 1:58 am so i guess i was eager to get this entry in.  just finished up a 2 hour vr session; i feel better now.  <br><br><a href="culture_society/247424134_4622366904474315_1086021457600591051_n.jpg">is it sad that i prefer virtual reality over actual reality?  i can't explain the feeling, but when i'm in the web browser on the headset, i feel disappointed that i am unable to be sucked entirely into the website.</a>  i guess this makes me cringe and bluepilled, but that's just how i feel.  <br><br>

        <a href="diary/3995203629_26fb31e2e2_z.jpg">my dream one of these days is that they'll figure out how to get rid of my body and just keep my brain hooked up to a computer.</a>  now, i sort of understand millennials when they complain about being "bags of meat on a hecking ball of dirt speeding through spacerino" 

      </p>

      <h2>august 29th, 2024</h2>

        <p>

        had a panic attack inside of my dream last night.  pretty sure it's related to the wellbutrin.<br><br>

        anyway, it's kind of hard to take asian people seriously in america. <br><br> this statement doesn't really come out of a place of hatred for asian people, it has more to do with the fact that <a href="diary/6b8ec1cdf337f0ee342e9ed63d3ebffe88d604be.jpg">the united states really has a way of inducing a sort of cultural amnesia in people</a> causing them to fill in the cultural gaps in their knowledge with some pretty cringey shit.<br><br>

        a few days ago, my girlfriend showed me her friend's instagram profile for his business which is a boba tea shop that doubles as a streetwear reseller.  boba drinks named after streetwear references and whatnot.  the whole website was done in the virgil abloh quotation marks style which was also kind of cringe.  <br><br>

        maybe i'm becoming old and i don't like it when i see other people having fun.  <a href="diary/maxresdefault.jpg">give it a few more generations and maybe boba and streetwear will be the only part of asian culture that will be remembered in the future.</a>  <br><br>

        i'm not saying this is a bad thing, personally i think it would be really funny if this happened.  maybe i shouldn't make these broad gestures about a culture i'm not really a part of.  just kidding, i'm probably gonna continue doing this for a while 

        </p>

      <h2>august 31st, 2024</h2>

      <p>

        at this point i’ve gotten accustomed to wellbutrin so i am now able to pull off a pretty convincing fluoride stare <br><br>

        <a href="diary/54dfc0cbd9b761fb276b428b99dc9589.jpg">how do i feel when i’m on this drug? well, i no longer want to make art anymore. any creative impulses that were lingering in my brain have now been beaten out. i just stare at my fucking computer all day and do nothing. i wish i were dead </a><br><br>

        for the past 23 years, i have been a very reactive person. i would intake stimuli, and just react without being fully present in the moment. <a href="old_photos/oldphotos 50.png">i was like a raw nerve for two decades, and i was unknowingly taken advantage of by people for this reason.</a> <br><br>

        i feel like if i talk to other people about this they’ll say some shit like the only person you can blame is yourself. And they're right. it just feels so good to have someone or some thing to blame though. i have largely forgotten what has happened in those years .  <a href="https://strauh.al/more_fine_art/FzBluNCWYAE5dtT.jpeg">The main emotions i feel now are a mixture of shame and regret knowing that i have probably been a burden to everyone i’ve met in my life.</a><br><br>

        i’ve been taking the metra a lot recently. <a href="diary/hf_1_2021_06_16.jpg">there tends to be a large number of amish people that travel through the station. they look so quaint.</a> right now i’m looking at an amish family and the husband and wife are wearing these strange hats and the son is dressed up in a pair of adorable overalls. <br><br>

        i’m thinking that they probably have better mental health than most terminally online American people do. Maybe we should all be amish.

        <a href="diary/90.jpeg">thinking about this quote today:</a><br><br>

        “For the new year. – i’m still alive; i still think: i must still be alive because i still have to think. Sum, ergo cogito: cogito, ergo sum.1 Today everyone allows himself to express his dearest wish and thoughts: so i, too, want to say what i wish from myself today and what thought first crossed my heart – what thought shall be the reason, warrant, and sweetness of the rest of my life! i want to learn more and more how to see what is necessary in things as what is beautiful in them – thus i will be one of those who make things beautiful. Amor fati:2 let that be my love from now on! i do not want to wage war against ugliness. i do not want to accuse; i do not even want to accuse the accusers. Let looking away be my only negation! And, all in all and on the whole: some day i want only to be a Yes-sayer!”

        i hear the phrase Angry Young Men™ quite a lot.  particularly from mainstream news outlets.  usually, these Angry Young Men™ often have the problem of feeling Rejected By Society™.<br><br> 

        trust me, we are not prepared for the next wave of Angry Young Men™ that will be headed our way.  if you thought the problem of Angry Young Men™ is bad now, it's gonna be way worse in a few years.  <br><br>

        when men and women from generation alpha see vaporwave edits of millennials and zoomers in the 2010s having fun and hanging out together before the pandemic with the caption <a href="diary/2ui17a4ychd51.jpg">Remember What They Took From You™,</a> we are going to see a shitstorm on a scale we can't even comprehend.  <a href="culture_society/where-were-the-azumangers-on-january-6th-v0-v9mi5ub62nwc1.jpg">hopefully this leads to a wave of people from gen alpha storming the capitol (again) lol.</a>  <br><br>

        <a href="culture_society/1640485909427.jpg">i occasionally wonder what it's like for people from other parts of the world to view america in its current state.</a>  the closest i ever got to this perspective was when i was working with an international student on a project proposal and they kept inserting the phrase "diversity and inclusion" into the proposal.  <br><br>

        i was puzzled by this as our project didn't remotely have anything to do with "diversity and inclusion" ...;  apparently (according to their logic) americans will automatically favor projects that have those words;  hahahahaha man what a life

        when i look back at all the music i made the past couple of years, i think 2022-early2023 was my slop era.  i would just take 15 second snippets of obscure songs and stretch them out to 6 minutes.  truly artistically bankrupt.  <a href="album_covers/thousand_knives.jpg">it wasn't until ryuichi sakamoto died that i realized i needed to put more effort into my music.</a>  <br><br>

        i feel doubly bad about his passing as his intern posted some shit about nfts on his twitter a few weeks before his death and i was a dickhead <a href="diary/ccef35970a1b37ba992357c18a803529b4d97b52c15b1bafc48fe4bb1f78bfc1_1.jpg">and replied with this image.</a> <br><br>

        something funny happened in the news recently.  those asian american groups that were so against Affirmative Action™ won in the supreme court ruling against yale and princeton, so they had to take Affirmative Action™ out of the application process .. <br><br> now the number of asian american students is at 24% instead of 30%  .<br><br>

        also i guess i should be more transparent to myself about the nature of this diary.  this is probably the first time in my life i've been able to keep up a journal for over a few weeks.  also, it's not like i'm writing this in a cute little moleskine book or anything, i'm writing this in html that will be hosted on a url for others to read if they have the link.  haven't really publicly or privately shared this with any people yet.  right now, it just feels like me and the internet.  <br><br>

        <a href="photography/couple.jpg">by that, i don't mean other people on the internet, i mean if the infrastructure powering the internet developed a consciousness, this diary would be a nice little secret that me and the internet would share.</a>

        i can't explain it, but growing up on the internet has caused me to develop a sort of pavlovian response to 9/11 related imagery.  every time i see something related to 9/11, <a href="culture_society/Fca2sPfXgAA2lT-.jpeg">i can't help but chuckle</a> <br><br>

        speaking of hijackers, i got to thinking..  people use the term "hijack" in the phrase "tiktok is hijacking your brain!"  if tiktok is hijacking our brains, what's the target?  which kind of metaphorical twin tower is tiktok trying to fly us into?  <br><br>

        in the future, everyone will either be an uber driver, a doordasher or an onlyfans model.  perhaps a combination of those things all at once.  everyone will also be genderfluid / nonbinary as well.  this fluidity will extend to politics, sports, language, employment, art, music, sexuality, religion, nationality, and race too lol.  <br><br>

        i think that would be so based.  <a href="diary/laion-clusters.jpeg">each of these characteristics will be labeled as vector coordinates in some sort of latent space.  people will be able to see the distances they've covered in each dimension of the latent space and they'll be able to see their own trajectories (along with everyone elses) through the space based on their current and past movement.</a>  <br><br>

      	thinking about a comment i saw on a music forum one time.  <a href="culture_society/iMG_3060.JPG">people were discussing "the right thing to say" when asked about what music they listened to.</a>  now, this question was posed to a forum with a ...  ..strange taste in music, think destroy all monsters, gerogerigegege, pere ubu, etc.  <br><br>

      	anyway, someone said that the best answer to that question in any situation is "a tribe called quest"<br><br>

      	apparently, if you say that, 100% of the time, people will nod their heads inquisitively and go "ah yes, a tribe called quest...."<br><br>

      	<a href="culture_society/iMG_0236.JPG">if i remember correctly, this commenter said that they've never actually listened to a tribe called quest in their life, however they did say this trick has never failed them in any social situation.</a><br><br>

        also this diary is now one month old!  i think i'll add a link to this diary from the homepage now<br><br>

      i guess i didn’t realize how often i use chatgpt to generate cover letters for jobs.  i have no qualms with this.  <a href="gif_collection/1632614795472.gif">the human soul was not created to write cover letters all day.</a>  however, i began to worry that i might forget how to write if i kept on depending on chatgpt to generate everything for me.  hence this diary.  and the tone too.  <br><br>

      i realized that you can easily bypass any of these “ai detector” websites if you just write in a casual tone and use lots of contractions like isn't, doesn't, hasn't, etc.  basically the opposite of academic writing.  <a href="more_fine_art/toppan2.png">if that’s what qualifies as “human” writing, i guess i desire to be more human than humanly possible.</a>  also, there’s another thing that chatgpt can’t do *yet*..;  that is writing in a really apathetic tone.  chatgpt tends to do everything in a very cheery, customer servicey kind of tone, which is a dead giveaway.   even when i ask chatgpt to sound really apathetic, it sounds apathetic in an enthusiastic kind of way.  <br><br>

      <a href="more_fine_art/joan-mitchell-musee-giverny-2.jpg">so i guess the reason i may sound apathetic in this diary is to convince myself that i’m still human.</a>

        i’ve been feeling more in touch with my high school self recently. <a href="old_photos/oldphotos 55.png">what do i mean by this..?</a> <br><br>

        when i was going to college for an undergraduate degree, i was slowly discovering myself and becoming more sociable.  however, i ended up regressing when the pandemic happened. i often think back to high school in the mornings at 6am.  <a href="fine_art/Adolph_Menzel_-_Flötenkonzert_Friedrichs_des_Großen_in_Sanssouci_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg">my band director switched me from the trumpet to the tuba, so i made a habit of bringing this massive instrument home every day only for it to just sit in the corner of my room.</a> <br><br>

        i didn’t even practice it at all.  <a href="fine_art/1627686459327.jpg">the only reason i lugged this thing around was so i could have an excuse for the janitor to unlock the door to the band room in the mornings so that i could sit in silence for two hours before school started.</a>

        <a href="old_photos/oldphotos 16.png">i guess i should explain this picture before i suddenly develop dementia or something.</a><br><br>

        this picture was taken of me on the first day of kindergarten and this might also be the first drawing i’ve ever made.  the teacher had provided a bunch of coloring sheets for all the students and everyone was doing a great job of coloring inside the lines…   …except for me.  this isn’t a metaphor for anything by the way, my parents saw the wall of coloring sheets that were stapled to the wall and my drawing stood out from the rest, and not in a good way.<br><br>  

        apparently, i had wrapped all 5 of my pudgy fingers around a green crayon and took the coloring sheet to task.  whether the sheet of paper had any outlines on it didn't matter at all because i covered the entire thing with scribbles.  now that i think about it, that might be why my kindergarten teacher told my parents that i might have been autistic.<br><br>

        also this first art memory reminds me of my first memory of pain.  a year after kindergarten when i was in the first grade, my mother told me to doodle something on a piece of paper for a city wide drawing competition.  anyway, i probably made something in less than 30 minutes and went back to doing whatever it is that five year olds do.  <a href="old_photos/oldphotos 117.png">what i had not expected was that my drawing was chosen over every other first grader’s drawing in the school district.  i mean really, this was not a technically skilled drawing for a five year old, especially compared to my classmates who had probably spent more time doing better drawings.</a><br><br>  

        annyyyyywayyyyyy, i had received a ribbon as an award for this drawing which hung on the top shelf in my bedroom.  one night, i climbed up the shelf to grab the ribbon and was swishing the ribbon through the air by its string.  however, the string that was attached to the ribbon snagged on the doorknob and tore all of the skin off of my ring finger.  not fun<br><br>

        hopefully this entry sheds some light on an early moment that might have led me to become the self indulgent, egomaniac piece of shit "artist" i am today.  <br><br>

        <a href="diary/jacfast3.png">also, to create art requires love.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and pain.</a><br><br>  

        something that these dork ass losers making ai art have probably never felt lol.

        went out to michigan for a friend’s birthday this weekend (and also sort of my birthday but not as much since it was 3 days away).  <a href="culture_society/316039365_179339704757870_2199304955362900529_n.jpg">did whatever it is that older people do.  wine tasting.  $200 on 10 bites of food.  i felt a strange sense of dread in the air.</a>  they asked me if i wanted anything for my birthday and i said i wanted to get hit by a truck.  i thought it was slightly funny but they didn’t laugh.  <br><br>

        i don’t even want to do anything for my birthday.  i just want to be alone.  later that night, i was asked again what i wanted for my birthday,;  i laughed and flatly told them i wish i were dead.  they jumped back and asked me to repeat myself to which i said “i wish i had a pet.”  then they started talking about hermit crabs as pets or something like that.  <br><br>

        i don’t even want a pet.  that was a lie.  i only chose that word because it sounded similar to dead.  i can’t even take care of myself properly, let alone a pet.  <a href="culture_society/332700874_590062542966362_7927382051136827917_n.jpg">my life isn’t even terrible;  i’m not living under a bridge or having my house carpet-bombed, but everything is just so tiring</a>

        **update (october 16th): i think i made this entry with my cousin stanley in mind.  i saw him when he was still in good health although his wife told me that he was going to be in a wheelchair in a few months because of ALS.  eventually he'll need to have a feeding tube.  <br><br>

        anyway, when i visited him and his family with my mother in new york last year, i thought it was gonna be pretty chill until my mom took a bible out of her purse and tried to christpill him.  to which he told my mother that a bunch of other aunts had tried to do the same.  his wife told me in another room that most people with ALS have 3 to 5 years to live after the diagnosis.

        randomly remembered something i saw a few miles away from my parent's home when i was back there in september.  i was wandering around in a large field and saw a shopping cart in the distance.  it felt very strange..;  it had a monumental quality about it., just sitting there by itself in the middle of this field.  and rightfully so.  the shopping cart is a uniquely american invention, for a uniquely american activity.  <br><br>

        also, perceptions of shopping carts can be very subjective.  what may be a negligible mode of transporting products or groceries for one person may be a vehicle filled with personal objects for another.<br><br>

        here's an excerpt from a wikipedia article about the early days of the shopping cart: <br><br>

        <i>The invention did not catch on immediately. Men found them effeminate; women found them suggestive of a baby carriage. "i've pushed my last baby buggy," offended women informed him. After hiring several male and female models to push his new invention around his store and demonstrate their utility, as well as greeters to explain their use, his folding-style shopping carts became extremely popular and Goldman became a multimillionaire by collecting a royalty on every folding design shopping cart in the United States.</i><br><br>

        <a href="more_fine_art/St-peters-basilica-interior-pannini-1735.jpg">i remember in third grade,  my teacher would place me in in the special education room? This was very strange to me, because i was just sitting around and we weren’t really doing anything:;,</a> there was basically no instruction going on. <br><br>

        anyway, perhaps she did that because she was upset that she couldn’t put me on ritalin after telling my mother that i might have ADHD. <a href="more_fine_art/tumblr_989687c381cdd655b835f3ab471c8494_33cf1a38_1280.jpg">i remember when i was placed in this particular teacher’s classroom, my mother was excited because this teacher had received the “teacher of the year award.”</a><br><br>

        i think i realized that most social media “activism” (or student activism) was bogus after that <a href="diary/rafah.jpg">“all eyes on rafah” post .  a few months ago, someone had used an AI GENERATED image of a bunch of refugee encampments that spelled out “all eyes on rafah" since israel was bombing the shit out of it.</a> <br><br>

        this image blew up in popularity (47 million reposts) and soon these ai sloppers were arguing over who created this image first.  <a href="diary/noshitsherlock.jpg">social media activism was always a race to the bottom</a> but at least people were pretending to keep up the facade of actual effort by creating art or slides specifically for these issues.  <br><br>

        i still keep myself up to date on this stuff, but after 1 or 2 performative gestures on my end, i realized that i was being a bit cringe.  everyone already has come to a general consensus that "war bad.  genocide bad."  like everything else after that point is just for optics lol<br><br>

        now people are just arguing over ai generated activism slop.  we’re at the bottom.  we’ve finally arrived<br><br>
