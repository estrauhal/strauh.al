      <p>

        today i have become so bored that i have decided to start a diary..;  currently stuck in some random suburb of illinois in my aunt and uncles basement and playing with this new drug my psychiatrist gave me called wellbutrin.  <br><br>

        i called walgreens today about my prescription and i could tell the person on the other end was getting fed up with how slow my brain was moving because of the drug.  <br><br>

        anyway, the reason i'm messing around with wellbutrin is because my psychiatrist diagnosed me with a whole grab bag of mental disorders.  <a href="https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.1727036282.9549/pp,504x498-pad,600x600,f8f8f8.u1.jpg">lol.</a>  in all honesty, i should have asked for something more fun like <a href="https://imgb.ifunny.co/images/9d9afbc1f26275513fdc46f387b1218fff22cd3b3b0208f3820b73a5784dd11d_1.jpg">ritalin or adderall</a><br><br>

        i'm sure i'll probably forget about this journal in a week when i inevitably find something new to hyperfixate on <br><br>

        it's 1:58 am so i guess i was eager to get this entry in.  just finished up a 2 hour vr session; i feel better now.  <br><br>is it sad that i prefer virtual reality over actual reality?  i can't explain the feeling, but when i'm in the web browser on the headset, i feel disappointed that i am unable to be sucked entirely into the website.  i guess this makes me cringe and bluepilled, but that's just how i feel.  <br><br>

        <a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/2629/3995203629_26fb31e2e2_z.jpg">my dream one of these days is that they'll figure out how to get rid of my body and just keep my brain hooked up to a computer.</a>  now, i sort of understand millennials when they complain about being "bags of meat on a hecking ball of dirt speeding through spacerino"

          had a panic attack inside of my dream last night.  pretty sure it's related to the wellbutrin.<br><br>

        anyway, i think it would be better if asian people didn't come to the u.s. <br><br> this statement doesn't really come out of a place of hatred for asian people, it has more to do with the fact that <a href="https://64.media.tumblr.com/23474fd409ac70beec7d639de9537e6b/1c6574a511fea016-db/s1280x1920/6b8ec1cdf337f0ee342e9ed63d3ebffe88d604be.jpg">the united states really has a way of inducing a sort of cultural amnesia in people</a> causing them to fill in the cultural gaps in their knowledge with some pretty cringey shit.<br><br>

        a few days ago, my girlfriend showed me her friend's instagram profile for his business which is a boba tea shop that doubles as a streetwear reseller.  boba drinks named after streetwear references and whatnot.  the whole website was done in the virgil abloh quotation marks style which was also kind of cringe.  <br><br>

        maybe i'm becoming old and i don't like it when i see other people having fun.  <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r5DWnZW8FNQ/maxresdefault.jpg">give it a few more generations and maybe boba and streetwear will be the only part of asian culture that will be remembered in the future.</a>  <br><br>

        i'm not saying this is a bad thing, personally i think it would be really funny if this happened.  maybe i shouldn't make these broad gestures about a culture i'm not really a part of.  just kidding, i'm probably gonna continue doing this for a while

        at this point i’ve gotten accustomed to wellbutrin so i am now able to pull off a pretty convincing fluoride stare <br><br>

        <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/54/df/c0/54dfc0cbd9b761fb276b428b99dc9589.jpg">how do i feel when i’m on this drug? well, i no longer want to make art anymore. any creative impulses that were lingering in my brain have now been beaten out. i just stare at my fucking computer all day and do nothing. i wish i were dead </a>

        i am seething.  malding.  <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FsAc3uOWYA8qQTA.jpg">no more copium in the tank.</a>  i generally feel like a leper .  anger is the only thing keeping me awake.  .  no matter how much i try to change things, <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GLOVzqiXoAAi_-u.jpg">Nothing Ever Happens.!</a>  the wellbutrin has worn off and i see the ugliness in my heart reflected in the world around me

        for the past 23 years, i have been a very reactive person. i would intake stimuli, and just react without being fully present in the moment. i was like a raw nerve for two decades, and i was unknowingly taken advantage of by people for this reason. <br><br>

        i feel like if i talk to other people about this they’ll say some shit like the only person you can blame is yourself. And they're right. it just feels so good to have someone or some thing to blame though. i have largely forgotten what has happened in those years .  <a href="https://strauh.al/more_fine_art/FzBluNCWYAE5dtT.jpeg">The main emotions i feel now are a mixture of shame and regret knowing that i have probably been a burden to everyone i’ve met in my life.</a>

        i’ve been taking the metra a lot recently. <a href="https://blog.geveo.com/img/hf_1_2021_06_16.jpg">there tends to be a large number of amish people that travel through the station. they look so quaint.</a> right now I’m looking at an amish family and the husband and wife are wearing these strange hats and the son is dressed up in a pair adorable overalls. <br><br>

        I’m thinking that they probably have better mental health than most terminally online American people do. Maybe we should all be amish.

        “For the new year. – I’m still alive; I still think: I must still be alive because I still have to think. Sum, ergo cogito: cogito, ergo sum.1 Today everyone allows himself to express his dearest wish and thoughts: so I, too, want to say what I wish from myself today and what thought first crossed my heart – what thought shall be the reason, warrant, and sweetness of the rest of my life! I want to learn more and more how to see what is necessary in things as what is beautiful in them – thus I will be one of those who make things beautiful. Amor fati:2 let that be my love from now on! I do not want to wage war against ugliness. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse the accusers. Let looking away be my only negation! And, all in all and on the whole: some day I want only to be a Yes-sayer!”
