      <p>

        today i have become so bored that i have decided to start a diary..;  currently stuck in some random suburb of illinois in my aunt and uncles basement and playing with this new drug my psychiatrist gave me called wellbutrin.  <br><br>

        i called walgreens today about my prescription and i could tell the person on the other end was getting fed up with how slow my brain was moving because of the drug.  <br><br>

        anyway, the reason i'm messing around with wellbutrin is because my psychiatrist diagnosed me with a whole grab bag of mental disorders.  <a href="https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.1727036282.9549/pp,504x498-pad,600x600,f8f8f8.u1.jpg">lol.</a>  in all honesty, i should have asked for something more fun like <a href="https://imgb.ifunny.co/images/9d9afbc1f26275513fdc46f387b1218fff22cd3b3b0208f3820b73a5784dd11d_1.jpg">ritalin or adderall</a><br><br>

        i'm sure i'll probably forget about this journal in a week when i inevitably find something new to hyperfixate on <br><br>

        it's 1:58 am so i guess i was eager to get this entry in.  just finished up a 2 hour vr session; i feel better now.  <br><br>is it sad that i prefer virtual reality over actual reality?  i can't explain the feeling, but when i'm in the web browser on the headset, i feel disappointed that i am unable to be sucked entirely into the website.  i guess this makes me cringe and bluepilled, but that's just how i feel.  <br><br>

        <a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/2629/3995203629_26fb31e2e2_z.jpg">my dream one of these days is that they'll figure out how to get rid of my body and just keep my brain hooked up to a computer.</a>  now, i sort of understand millennials when they complain about being "bags of meat on a hecking ball of dirt speeding through spacerino"

        <p>had a panic attack inside of my dream last night.  pretty sure it's related to the wellbutrin.<br><br>

        anyway, i think it would be better if asian people didn't come to the u.s. <br><br> this statement doesn't really come out of a place of hatred for asian people, it has more to do with the fact that <a href="https://64.media.tumblr.com/23474fd409ac70beec7d639de9537e6b/1c6574a511fea016-db/s1280x1920/6b8ec1cdf337f0ee342e9ed63d3ebffe88d604be.jpg">the united states really has a way of inducing a sort of cultural amnesia in people</a> causing them to fill in the cultural gaps in their knowledge with some pretty cringey shit.<br><br>

        a few days ago, my girlfriend showed me her friend's instagram profile for his business which is a boba tea shop that doubles as a streetwear reseller.  boba drinks named after streetwear references and whatnot.  the whole website was done in the virgil abloh quotation marks style which was also kind of cringe.  <br><br>

        maybe i'm becoming old and i don't like it when i see other people having fun.  <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r5DWnZW8FNQ/maxresdefault.jpg">give it a few more generations and maybe boba and streetwear will be the only part of asian culture that will be remembered in the future.</a>  <br><br>

        i'm not saying this is a bad thing, personally i think it would be really funny if this happened.  maybe i shouldn't make these broad gestures about a culture i'm not really a part of.  just kidding, i'm probably gonna continue doing this for a while
