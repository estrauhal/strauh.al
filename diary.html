      <p>

        today i have become so bored that i have decided to start a diary..;  currently stuck in some random suburb of illinois in my aunt and uncles basement and playing with this new drug my psychiatrist gave me called wellbutrin.  <br><br>

        i called walgreens today about my prescription and i could tell the person on the other end was getting fed up with how slow my brain was moving because of the drug.  <br><br>

        anyway, the reason i'm messing around with wellbutrin is because my psychiatrist diagnosed me with a whole grab bag of mental disorders.  <a href="./diary/pp,504x498-pad,600x600,f8f8f8.u1.jpg">lol.</a>  in all honesty, i should have asked for something more fun like <a href="./diary/artworks-GJKOxCkv18IZNWZt-QBaIiQ-t500x500.jpg">ritalin or adderall</a><br><br>

        i'm sure i'll probably forget about this journal in a week when i inevitably find something new to hyperfixate on <br><br>

        <a href="https://strauh.al/more_fine_art/Harmony1956_Armonia_-RemediosVaro_6543542b-437e-46e1-b2db-e1e4d9b5bd13.jpg">here's a painting</a>

      <h2>august 28th, 2024</h2>

        <p>

        it's 1:58 am so i guess i was eager to get this entry in.  just finished up a 2 hour vr session; i feel better now.  <br><br><a href="./culture_society/247424134_4622366904474315_1086021457600591051_n.jpg">is it sad that i prefer virtual reality over actual reality?  i can't explain the feeling, but when i'm in the web browser on the headset, i feel disappointed that i am unable to be sucked entirely into the website.</a>  i guess this makes me cringe and bluepilled, but that's just how i feel.  <br><br>

        <a href="./diary/3995203629_26fb31e2e2_z.jpg">my dream one of these days is that they'll figure out how to get rid of my body and just keep my brain hooked up to a computer.</a>  now, i sort of understand millennials when they complain about being "bags of meat on a hecking ball of dirt speeding through spacerino" 

      </p>

      <h2>august 29th, 2024</h2>

        <p>

        had a panic attack inside of my dream last night.  pretty sure it's related to the wellbutrin.<br><br>

        anyway, it's kind of hard to take asian people seriously in america. <br><br> this statement doesn't really come out of a place of hatred for asian people, it has more to do with the fact that <a href="./diary/6b8ec1cdf337f0ee342e9ed63d3ebffe88d604be.jpg">the united states really has a way of inducing a sort of cultural amnesia in people</a> causing them to fill in the cultural gaps in their knowledge with some pretty cringey shit.<br><br>

        a few days ago, my girlfriend showed me her friend's instagram profile for his business which is a boba tea shop that doubles as a streetwear reseller.  boba drinks named after streetwear references and whatnot.  the whole website was done in the virgil abloh quotation marks style which was also kind of cringe.  <br><br>

        maybe i'm becoming old and i don't like it when i see other people having fun.  <a href="./diary/maxresdefault.jpg">give it a few more generations and maybe boba and streetwear will be the only part of asian culture that will be remembered in the future.</a>  <br><br>

        i'm not saying this is a bad thing, personally i think it would be really funny if this happened.  maybe i shouldn't make these broad gestures about a culture i'm not really a part of.  just kidding, i'm probably gonna continue doing this for a while 

        </p>

      <p>

        at this point i’ve gotten accustomed to wellbutrin so i am now able to pull off a pretty convincing fluoride stare <br><br>

        <a href="./diary/54dfc0cbd9b761fb276b428b99dc9589.jpg">how do i feel when i’m on this drug? well, i no longer want to make art anymore. any creative impulses that were lingering in my brain have now been beaten out. i just stare at my fucking computer all day and do nothing. i wish i were dead </a>

      </p>

        i am seething.  malding.  <a href="./diary/FsAc3uOWYA8qQTA.jpg">no more copium in the tank.</a>  i generally feel like a leper .  anger is the only thing keeping me awake.  .  no matter how much i try to change things, <a href="./diary/GLOVzqiXoAAi_-u.jpg">Nothing Ever Happens™.!</a>  the wellbutrin has worn off and i see the ugliness in my heart reflected in the world around me <br><br>

        **update (september 7th): i think i was trying to be really angsty when i wrote this.;.  i can't remember if this was meant to be sincere, ironic, or post-ironic 

      </p>

      <h2>september 2nd, 2024</h2>

      <p>

        for the past 23 years, i have been a very reactive person. i would intake stimuli, and just react without being fully present in the moment. i was like a raw nerve for two decades, and i was unknowingly taken advantage of by people for this reason. <br><br>

        i feel like if i talk to other people about this they’ll say some shit like the only person you can blame is yourself. And they're right. it just feels so good to have someone or some thing to blame though. i have largely forgotten what has happened in those years .  <a href="https://strauh.al/more_fine_art/FzBluNCWYAE5dtT.jpeg">The main emotions i feel now are a mixture of shame and regret knowing that i have probably been a burden to everyone i’ve met in my life.</a>

      </p>

      <h2>september 3rd, 2024</h2>

      <p>

        i’ve been taking the metra a lot recently. <a href="./diary/hf_1_2021_06_16.jpg">there tends to be a large number of amish people that travel through the station. they look so quaint.</a> right now I’m looking at an amish family and the husband and wife are wearing these strange hats and the son is dressed up in a pair adorable overalls. <br><br>

        I’m thinking that they probably have better mental health than most terminally online American people do. Maybe we should all be amish.

        <a href="./diary/90.jpeg">thinking about this quote today:</a><br><br>

        “For the new year. – I’m still alive; I still think: I must still be alive because I still have to think. Sum, ergo cogito: cogito, ergo sum.1 Today everyone allows himself to express his dearest wish and thoughts: so I, too, want to say what I wish from myself today and what thought first crossed my heart – what thought shall be the reason, warrant, and sweetness of the rest of my life! I want to learn more and more how to see what is necessary in things as what is beautiful in them – thus I will be one of those who make things beautiful. Amor fati:2 let that be my love from now on! I do not want to wage war against ugliness. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse the accusers. Let looking away be my only negation! And, all in all and on the whole: some day I want only to be a Yes-sayer!”

        i hear the phrase Angry Young Men™ quite a lot.  particularly from mainstream news outlets.  usually, these Angry Young Men™ often have the problem of feeling Rejected By Society™.<br><br> 

        trust me, we are not prepared for the next wave of Angry Young Men™ that will be headed our way.  if you thought the problem of Angry Young Men™ is bad now, it's gonna be way worse in a few years.  <br><br>

        when men and women from generation alpha see vaporwave edits of millennials and zoomers in the 2010s having fun and hanging out together before the pandemic with the caption <a href="./diary/2ui17a4ychd51.jpg">Remember What They Took From You™,</a> we are going to see a shitstorm on a scale we can't even comprehend.  <a href="./culture_society/where-were-the-azumangers-on-january-6th-v0-v9mi5ub62nwc1.jpg">hopefully this leads to a wave of people from gen alpha storming the capitol (again) lol.</a>  <br><br>

        who knows, maybe they'll actually change something.  oh wait, nevermind.  i forgot, <a href="./diary/GLOVzqiXoAAi_-u.jpg">Nothing Ever Happens™</a>

        <a href="./culture_society/1640485909427.jpg">i occasionally wonder what it's like for people from other parts of the world to view america in its current state.</a>  the closest i ever got to this perspective was when i was working with an international student on a project proposal and they kept inserting the phrase "diversity and inclusion" into the proposal.  <br><br>

        i was puzzled by this as our project didn't remotely have anything to do with "diversity and inclusion" ...;  apparently (according to their logic) americans will automatically favor projects that have those words;  hahahahaha man what a life

        nothings happened since so it all kind of feels pointless at the moment.  maybe something crazy will happen in the next few years;  just kidding!  <a href="./diary/GLOVzqiXoAAi_-u.jpg">Nothing Ev</a>-<a href="./diary/1fd.png">ACK</a>

        when i look back at all the music i made the past couple of years, i think 2022-early2023 was my slop era.  i would just take 15 second snippets of obscure songs and stretch them out to 6 minutes.  truly artistically bankrupt.  <a href="./album_covers/thousand_knives.jpg">it wasn't until ryuichi sakamoto died that i realized i needed to put more effort into my music.</a>  <br><br>

        i feel doubly bad about his passing as his intern posted some shit about nfts on his twitter a few weeks before his death and i was a dickhead <a href="./diary/ccef35970a1b37ba992357c18a803529b4d97b52c15b1bafc48fe4bb1f78bfc1_1.jpg">and replied with this image.</a> <br><br>

        something funny happened in the news recently.  those asian american groups that were so against Affirmative Action™ won in the supreme court ruling against yale and princeton, so they had to take Affirmative Action™ out of the application process .. <br><br> now the number of asian american students is at 24% instead of 30%  .<br><br>

        <a href="./photography/FRnCczDVgAA1gMP.jpeg">decided to look up all my old classmates.  don't know what i expected to find.  everyone's off doing their own thing.  they're all... old and boring.  just like me.</a>  <br><br>

        also i guess i should be more transparent to myself about the nature of this diary.  this is probably the first time in my life i've been able to keep up a journal for over a few weeks.  also, it's not like i'm writing this in a cute little moleskine book or anything, i'm writing this in html that will be hosted on a url for others to read if they have the link.  haven't really publicly or privately shared this with any people yet.  right now, it just feels like me and the internet.  <br><br>

        <a href="./photography/couple.jpg">by that, i don't mean other people on the internet, i mean if the infrastructure powering the internet developed a consciousness, this diary would be a nice little secret that me and the internet would share.</a>

        i can't explain it, but growing up on the internet has caused me to develop a sort of pavlovian response to 9/11 related imagery.  every time i see something related to 9/11, <a href="./culture_society/Fca2sPfXgAA2lT-.jpeg">i can't help but chuckle</a> <br><br>

        speaking of hijackers, i got to thinking..  people use the term "hijack" in the phrase "tiktok is hijacking your brain!"  if tiktok is hijacking our brains, what's the target?  which kind of metaphorical twin tower is tiktok trying to fly us into?  <br><br>

        <a href="./culture_society/IMG_4371.JPG">good ;  they should also ban instagram reels and youtube shorts as well.  it might suck for everyone in the short term but millions (perhaps billions) of man-hours will be taken back.  think of all the things we could accomplish [collectively]</a><br><br>

        also now that i think about it, that's probably the reason i gave up on starting a record label haha.  how can artists/musicians compete with an endless stream of entertainment that is tailored to the user?  i should have realized this well before i even started working on the webpage/bandcamp page for the label considering that tiktok was already around for a few years

        in the future, everyone will either be an uber driver, a doordasher or an onlyfans model . everyone will also be genderfluid / nonbinary as well.  this fluidity will extend to politics, sports, language, employment, art, music, sexuality, religion, nationality, and race too lol.  <br><br>

        i think that would be so based.  <a href="./diary/laion-clusters.jpeg">each of these characteristics will be labeled as vector coordinates in some sort of latent space.  people will be able to see the distances they've covered in each dimension of the latent space and they'll be able to see their own trajectories (along with everyone elses) through the space based on their current and past movement.</a>  <br><br>
