    <h1><a href="http://strauh.al">strauh.al</a> is a repository of almost everything I (<a href="http://ernest.strauh.al">ernest.strauh.al</a>) have consumed through the internet since 2015/2016ish.  My artworks and music live on <a href="https://studio.strauh.al">studio.strauh.al</a>.<br><br>
    
    This website is forever a work in progress, as there are currently 1,432 images in my downloads folder that I need to sort, along with other folders on my hard drive that still have to be uploaded to this website.  My bookmarks in my web browser are also getting out of hand and need to be sorted soon so that they can be uploaded to the "<a href="http://strauh.al/knowledge_base">knowledge_base</a>" portion of this website.<br><br>

    This site runs on GitHub pages, and can be viewed on the GitHub website here: <a href="https://github.com/strauhal/strauh.al">github.com/strauhal/strauh.al</a>.  The design language of <a href="http://strauh.al">strauh.al</a> is purposely bleak as I've tried to keep the HTML and CSS code to the bare minimum.  As of January 2023, there is no Javascript code on this website.<br><br>

    Talking to people in real life is often tedious and slow, and I much prefer this method of disseminating information about myself in the form of this website, where I can hyperlink thoughts, ideas, and influences.</h2>
