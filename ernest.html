        Ernest Strauhal (b. 2000, San Francisco) works in sound, printmedia, sculpture, and installation. Drawing references from the environment, he incorporates sounds such as birds chirping, ambulance sirens, wind sounds, and samples downloaded from random places in his works. He sculpts ambient and abrasive soundscapes to open up new ways of listening.
