    <h1><a href="http://strauh.al">strauh.al</a> has over 4000 images on this website.  i'm guessing there's a similar amount of hyperlinks in the knowledge base portion of this website.  <br><br>

    if you see something that might suggest any political, religious, or personal leanings, please know that i am physically incapable of vetting the thousands of images i see every day.  there might possibly be some ai slop that slipped through my fingers in the process of collecting images. <br><br>

    also this site doesn't use cookies.  i'm not really interested in tracking you online to sell you things.  if (for whatever reason) you do want me to know you better, feel free to start a conversation by emailing me at <a href="mailto:ernest@strauh.al">ernest@strauh.al</a><br><br>
